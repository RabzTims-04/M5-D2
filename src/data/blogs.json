All you need to do after you thought it up is actually write it and presto a new thing is created into the world. That really feels like being a wizard.</h2><h2>Unlike physics where physical restraints are in everything you do, there are no limitations in coding besides your ability to think of a logically consistent solution. When writing an application you do not need to think about the strength of the material, what will happen when there is wear and tear or how you will reach an element to fix it 3 years down the road. It is virtual in a good sense and everything that comes with it.</h2>",
